# Vending Map

## Description

The "Vending Map" project aims to create a comprehensive digital map displaying the locations of various vending machines accessible to the public. This interactive map will provide detailed information about the products available in each vending machine, including snacks, drinks, and other goods. The project's primary goal is to enhance convenience for individuals seeking quick access to refreshments and necessities in public spaces, thereby improving overall user experience and accessibility.

## Backend

Backend for the vending machine map will utilize Java Spring framework for robust and efficient server-side programming, seamlessly integrated with a PostgreSQL database for secure data storage and management.

## Frontend

Frontend for the vending machine map utilizes Elm, a functional programming language I studied during the NI-AFP course. Known for its emphasis on simplicity and correctness, Elm ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for the application's interface.
