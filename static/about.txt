Welcome to our website! This project has been an exciting learning experience for me. I had the opportunity to explore various technologies and tools to develop a website focusing on creating a Vending Map, highlighting the locations of vending machines and promoting convenience for users.

For the server-side, I employed Java Spring along with Hibernate, a robust framework for web applications. This combination efficiently handled routing and facilitated the creation of RESTful APIs, providing a solid foundation for the backend infrastructure.

The incorporation of Hibernate ORM into my project simplified my interaction with the PostgreSQL database. It offered a straightforward and intuitive approach to execute SQL queries, retrieve data, and perform essential database tasks seamlessly within my Java codebase.

To optimize performance and organization, I integrated webpack, a module bundler.

For the vending machine map, I utilized Mapbox, a versatile mapping platform. Its APIs and tools assisted me in creating an interactive map displaying the locations of vending machines in different areas.

The core of the web application was written in Java, utilizing the Spring framework. I implemented features such as search functionalities, encouraging users to easily locate vending machines and explore the variety of products they offer.

Throughout the development process, I gained insights into web development practices, including front-end design, back-end integration, and creating an intuitive map experience for users.
